# Cross-harness compatibility matrix

How completely each `wise` skill ports to each harness. Generated from the
committed ports; see each `harnesses/<harness>/wise/README.md` for install
steps and `CONTRIBUTING.md` §10 for the maintenance model.

Legend: **✓ full** — ships as-is (pure prose + git/gh). **~ adapted** — ships
with a per-harness *Harness adaptation note* mapping Claude-specific tools
(subagent dispatch, AskUserQuestion, the Skill tool, TodoWrite) to the
harness's equivalents. **✗ —** — not shipped (Claude Code only).

## Claude-only skills — why

- **`wise-init`** — Claude dep-probe wizard; replaced by each port README's Prerequisites.
- **`wise-insights-mine`** — self-improvement loop needs the SessionEnd hook + Claude transcript format.
- **`wise-insights-refine`** — operates on the Claude insights store.
- **`wise-insights-reset`** — operates on the Claude insights store.
- **`wise-skills-create`** — delegates to Claude's skill-creator.
- **`wise-skills-edit`** — delegates to Claude's skill-creator.
- **`wise-supervise`** — background-team watchdog (TeamCreate / Monitor / heartbeats).

## Workflows

All four bundled workflows (`ticket-auto`, `ticket-plan`, `impl-plan-auto`,
`example-workflow`) ship to every port. The workflow **engine**
(`scripts/workflows.py`) runs unchanged; the **conductor**
(`/wise-workflow-run` / `-resume`) carries a per-harness execution note
mapping each step type to that harness's primitives. Parallelism varies:
Claude and Hermes run team steps as parallel subagents; Codex uses subagents
where available; Cursor runs them sequentially (same result, longer
wall-clock). The self-improvement loop (SessionEnd hook + insights) is
**Claude Code only**.
