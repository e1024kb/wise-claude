# Cross-harness compatibility matrix

How completely each `wise` skill ports to each harness. Generated from the
committed ports; see each `harnesses/<harness>/wise/README.md` for install
steps and `CONTRIBUTING.md` §10 for the maintenance model.

Legend: **✓ full** — ships as-is (pure prose + git/gh; on non-Claude ports
this still means shared-file paths rewritten to `${WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` with
its baked default, plus a one-line shared-file-resolution note). **~
adapted** — ships with a per-harness *Harness adaptation note* mapping
Claude-specific tools (subagent dispatch, AskUserQuestion, the Skill tool,
TodoWrite) to the harness's equivalents. **✗ —** — not shipped (Claude Code
only).

## Claude-only skills — why

- **`wise-insights-mine`** — self-improvement loop needs the SessionEnd hook + Claude transcript format.
- **`wise-insights-refine`** — operates on the Claude insights store.
- **`wise-insights-reset`** — operates on the Claude insights store.
- **`wise-skills-create`** — delegates to Claude's skill-creator.
- **`wise-skills-edit`** — delegates to Claude's skill-creator.
- **`wise-supervise`** — background-team watchdog (TeamCreate / Monitor / heartbeats).

## Workflows

All four bundled workflows (`ticket-auto`, `ticket-plan`, `impl-plan-auto`,
`example-workflow`) ship to every port. The workflow **engine**
(`scripts/workflows.py`) runs unchanged; the **conductor**
(`/wise-workflow-run` / `-resume`) carries a per-harness execution note
mapping each step type to that harness's primitives. Parallelism varies:
Claude, Hermes, and opencode run team steps as parallel subagents (opencode
via `Task`-tool subagents / `wise-<role>` agent cards); Codex uses subagents
where available; Cursor and Pi run them sequentially — Pi ships no
subagents at all, so the conductor adopts each role card itself (same
result, longer wall-clock). The self-improvement loop (SessionEnd hook +
insights) is **Claude Code only**.
