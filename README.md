`wise-claude` is the home of the **`wise`** copilot: flat `/wise-*` skills,
multi-agent **workflows**, and an SDLC **agent roster** (CEO / CTO /
architect / engineer / QA / security / SRE / …) that take everyday
engineering chores off your plate — drafting commits, opening and
shepherding PRs, planning tickets, authoring PRDs/TRDs, auditing a scope
into an executable backlog. Reach for a single quick command, or hand off
a whole **ticket → merged-PR** pipeline to run unattended.

It's maintained as a harness-neutral **`core/`** plus a hand-maintained
**port per harness** under `harnesses/<harness>/wise/`, so the same copilot
installs natively on whichever agent you use. **26 of the 32 skills and all
four workflows** port to every harness; see the
[compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md).

## Install

From a clone, the **universal installer** covers every harness:

```
./install.sh <claude|codex|cursor|hermes>          # user-wide
./install.sh cursor --project ./my-repo            # into one project
```

…or via [`just`](https://just.systems):

```
just install codex
just install cursor project=./my-repo
```

Each harness also has a **canonical install** (and each port's
`harnesses/<harness>/wise/README.md` has the exact steps):

| Harness | Canonical install |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add e1024kb/wise-claude` then `/plugin install wise@wise-claude` |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | `./install.sh codex` — uses `codex plugin marketplace add` + `codex plugin install wise` when the CLI is present (catalog: `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) |
| **Cursor** | `./install.sh cursor` (skills → `~/.cursor/skills/`; per-project: `--project <dir>`) |
| **Hermes Agent** | `./install.sh hermes` (skills → `~/.hermes/skills/`) |

On the non-Claude ports the installer lays the whole pack at a **stable
shared root** (`~/.local/share/wise/harness/<harness>`) that skills and
workflows resolve **by default — no env vars needed**; export
`WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` only to override it. Copying the skills alone is not a
working install — the port READMEs show the exact two-step manual
alternative. On every harness, run the `wise-init` skill once to probe
dependencies, and `/wise` to print the full command catalog.

## What you get

Availability varies per harness — see the
[compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md).

### Skills

- **Git & commits** — `/wise-commit-message` (draft only), `/wise-commit`
  (draft + commit), `/wise-commit-push` (draft + commit + push), all
  Conventional-Commits aware.
- **Pull requests** — `/wise-pr-create`, `/wise-pr-add-reviewers`,
  `/wise-pr-watch` (drive CI + review comments to green).
- **Planning & docs** — interactive ticket planning, `/wise-grill` (deep-
  research a ticket / doc / prompt into a plan, blueprint, or answer),
  `/wise-revise` (audit a scope and write executable improvement plans
  into `docs/plans/`), the model-invoked `wise-prd-architect` /
  `wise-trd-architect` document authors, and the `wise-estimation`
  story-point reference.
- **Authoring** — `/wise-skills-create`, `/wise-skills-edit`, and the
  `/wise-workflow-*` family for building and running your own workflows.
- **The `/wise` helper** — type `/wise <free-form text>` (e.g. `/wise open a
  PR`) and it classifies the request and offers the matching command.
- **Autonomous `-auto` building blocks** — decision-free, prompt-free
  variants (`/wise-pr-create-auto`, `/wise-implement-plan-auto`,
  `/wise-code-review-auto`, …) used by the unattended pipelines.

### Workflows (multi-step, multi-agent)

- **`ticket-auto`** — autonomous ticket → plan → implement → review → PR →
  watch CI → resolve review bots → merge, with no prompts.
- **`impl-plan-auto`** — same autonomous pipeline, but fed a ready
  `PLAN-*.md` (e.g. one `/wise-revise` wrote): re-plan from the file →
  implement → review → PR → watch → merge.
- **`ticket-plan`** — autonomous planning you review and adjust before you
  implement.

The workflow **engine** runs on every harness; the **conductor** maps each
step to that harness's primitives (parallel subagents on Claude / Hermes,
sequential on Cursor, subagents-where-available on Codex — see each port's
`/wise-workflow-run` execution note).

See the [Claude port's plugin README](harnesses/claude/wise/README.md) for
the full command reference and [`docs/wise/`](docs/wise/) for the workflow
engine, the `/wise` dispatcher, and the skill-authoring guides.

## Requirements

- **A supported harness** — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Cursor, or
  Nous Research Hermes Agent.
- **`git`**, and an authenticated **`gh` CLI** for the PR skills.
- **Python 3** (with `pyyaml` + `python-ulid`) for the workflow engine.
- The `wise-init` skill (all harnesses) probes these and walks you through
  anything missing; each port README also lists its prerequisites.

## Repository layout

The repo is organized by harness (a v3.0.0 layout change — see the
migration note). `core/` is the canonical harness-neutral source; each
`harnesses/<harness>/wise/` folder is an independently installable port
that vendors from it.

```

## Migrating from v2.x → v3.0.0

v3.0.0 moves the Claude Code plugin from `plugins/wise/` to
`harnesses/claude/wise/` (a backward-incompatible **layout** change; the
plugin's commands and behaviour are unchanged). The marketplace still
lives at the repo root, and its plugin `source` now points at the new
path.

- **Fresh installs** — nothing to do; `/plugin install wise@wise-claude`
  works as before.
- **Existing installs** — refresh the marketplace so it re-reads the new
  source path:
  ```
  /plugin marketplace update wise-claude
  /plugin install wise@wise-claude
  ```
  If commands still don't resolve, remove and re-add the marketplace
  (`/plugin marketplace remove wise-claude`, then the two Install
  commands above) and start a fresh session.

## Troubleshooting

- **Skills / commands don't show up** — confirm the install step for your
  harness ran (Claude: `/plugin install`; Codex: `codex plugin install`;
  Cursor / Hermes: the skills copied into `~/.cursor/skills` /
  `~/.hermes/skills`), then start a fresh session.
- **A skill or workflow can't find its shared files** (non-Claude ports) —
  the shared root is missing: run `./install.sh <harness>` (it lays the
  whole pack at `~/.local/share/wise/harness/<harness>`, the path skills
  resolve by default), or export `WISE_PLUGIN_ROOT` to wherever you put
  the pack.
- **PR / workflow steps fail on auth** — run the `wise-init` skill;
  everywhere, make sure `gh auth status` is green and an `origin` remote
  exists.
- **`/wise` can't classify a request** — type the `/wise-` prefix to browse
  every command in the menu.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the
conventions, local-install steps, validation checks, and the **§10
cross-harness sync model** (edit `core/` first, then propagate to each
port). You can also file feedback from inside the agent with
`/wise-feedback`.
